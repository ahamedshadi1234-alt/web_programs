<h1><b><u><center>Description</center></u></b></h1>
<p><center>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat 1-8 people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than cargo.[1][2] There are around 1.644 billion cars in use worldwide as of January 2025.[3]

The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced[4][5] and mass-affordable[6][7][8] cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[9] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[10] In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries.</p></center>
